<p>The YZF-R15 changed the 150cc segment in the Indian market the way the CBZ did when it was launched. It was an everyday motorcycle that could genuinely be used as a trackday tool. The second version of the R15 traded practicality for more focused performance, but the advent of the KTM RC200 meant that much better performance was available for the sportbike enthusiast at a similar price. The R15 V3 reduces that gap significantly with technology. On the list are an engine with a few more ccs, but variable valve timing takes the maximum power output to nearly 19bhp with a nominal decrease in maximum torque while spreading that torque over a wider rev range. It also gets all-LED lamps and an all-digital LCD instrument cluster that displays a wealth of information, including when the Variable Valve Actuation switches to the different camshaft profile.
