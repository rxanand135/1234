<p>TVS will be racing a race version of the Apache RR 310 in their one-make race series. The Apache RR 310 is TVS's flagship motorcycle that sits in the 300cc entry sports bike category.
The Apache RR 310 looks striking with its track focussed design and on the road looks more like a 600cc motorcycle. Fit and finish and switchgear quality is top notch. Despite its sporty design, it has fairly comfortable ergonomics. Coupled with the torquey and tractable motor, riding the RR 310 is an effortless affair. Ride quality despite being set on the stiffer side is plush. Headlamp focus is good but could have done well with a wider spread. Mirrors offer fantastic visibility. It handles quite well and feels light-footed in the city. Brakes lack initial feel but offer good bite. Tyres grip well in dry conditions. The downsides are vibrations, especially around the 6000rpm range. TVS have been working to reduce them, the latest improvement being the addition of new, larger bar-end weights.
